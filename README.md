Coursera Assignment - Peer Graded Getting and Cleaning Data
=======================================


The files in this repository are designed to show that I can collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal of this assignment is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.



The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- CodeBook.md : Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector and the data transformations applied.
- README.md
- run_analysis.R : The R code that transforms the raw data into a tidy summary dataset
- tidy_summary.csv : The tidy summary dataset, the averages of all mean and standard deviation measurements
